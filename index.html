            <p>Prairie Protection Colorado(PPC) is a non-profit organization that advocates for prairie dogs by drawing attention to the mass exterminations of prairie dog colonies through organizing and resisting the destruction of the last remaining prairie communities. Their website was designed to promote awareness around prairie dog endangerment and allow users to support their cause online.</p>

                <div class="col-6">
                    <p>My team and I observed that users often have <em>trouble finding the information</em> they need and found the <em>unprofessional/sketchy look</em> of the PPC’s website off-putting, preventing users from engaging with PPC in meaningful ways like volunteering or working with PPC to save their own local colony. This results in <em>missed opportunities for involvement from potential supporters—leaving the prairie dogs to fend for themselves.</em></p>
                    <p>The solution is to redesign and organize the PPC’s website so that (1) <em>our users feel empowered and informed</em> about the PPC and its cause, (2) users can <em>easily find the information</em> they need, and (3) get <em>users returning to the website.</em></p>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>Our initial approach to conducting our user interviews was to gather insight on what components/factors would make a nonprofit organization seem legitimate/reliable based on their website. I identified to my team while that was useful information, we could also add on a usability test to discover key weaknesses about the website that our team could improve.<br><br>We conducted qualitative interviews + usability tests with 5 participants and found:</p>

            <h3>Stakeholder interview</h3>
            <p>During our stakeholder interview, with Deanna Meyer Treasurer of PPC, our goal was to find out what PPC need their website to do for them, and they wanted the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To <em>find more actionable activists</em> the join the fight not only for the prairie dog, but all of the wildlife along the Rocky Mountains that are being encroached upon due to developments.</li>
                <li>To obtain <em>more donations</em> to use in processes of saving the prairie dogs.</li>
                <li>To have an <em>overall more professional, sleek, and inviting look</em> to the website</li>

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>I conducted a direct competitor analysis with Prairie Dog Coalition and Prairie Dog Pals. We also analyzed some indirect competitors: GoFundMe and Denver Urban Garden.<br><br>Takeaways from our Competitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Hero image</em></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We can utilize a hero image to encase PPC’s mission statement. This would allow users to immediately see their mission statement and have a central idea of not only what the organization is about but also an idea of what they might expect when visiting the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><em>Content chunking</em></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because the content in PPC’s website is not sectioned out, it makes it difficult for users to digest the information their reading which can be off-putting. This further prevents users from being informed about prairie dogs and how to protect them, leaving them to fend for themselves. Content chunking on the PPC’s website would allow users to easily digest the information and be fully informed about what they’re reading.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><em>“Call to Action” buttons</em></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some buttons on PPC’s website are not active and can cause confusion to users what is and isn’t clickable. By adding “call to action” button, this gives the user a straightforward approach on what they can do.</li>

            <p>All in all. on our homepage, participants were <em>confused</em> about how the sections of the navigation bar and multiple users were tripped up by the <em>mention of wildcats</em> on the prairie. In addition, while reviewing our Save a Colony page, users desired a more comprehensive explanation of what the PPC can do to help you save prairie dogs.<br><br>Solution:<br><br>Overall, this identified a need for better cohesion within our navigation and sitemap. We would need to overhaul our navigation and create a new primary-level page: <em>Partner Causes</em>. This would create a space for the Colorado Wildcat initiative as well as any future partnerships that may emerge.</p>

            <p>While creating the mobile prototype, I wanted to ensure that we were meeting our stakeholder’s needs. For example, one of our stakeholder’s goals is to acquire more donations through their website. Our desktop header had 3 different buttons: newsletter signup, Facebook, and donation. I prioritized our donation button and decided for the mobile header that the 2 main button/icons on the mobile header were the primary navigation and donation. <br><br>Due to time constraints, we were not able to test our mobile prototype; however, in the future, I would be interested to see users feedback and iterate based on their experiences.</p>
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>As a team, we were challenged to balance the many offerings of a non-profit organization within a single website. We focused in on PPC’s ability to kickstart a passionate prairie dog lover with the tools they need to fight for justice. This prototype gives a preview of how PPC could better appeal to users through clear, sleek design and a more simplified navigation.<br><br>As an individual, I was challenged with balancing life and work. I was dealing with a family emergency during the time of this project, and I learned to communicate with my instructor and my team members who were very understanding and supportive of my situation. We were able to delegate as a team what I could do and when I was assigning myself too much. I was extremely proud of my team and I for this.</p>
            <h3>Future Opportunities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Partner Causes</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We would love to <em>develop more on Partner Causes.</em> While PPC is currently only partnered with Colorado Wildcats, we do see PPC potentially partnering with other wildlife organizations too.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Integration with Social Media</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PPC's main social media is Facebook, and we want to <em>integrate Facebook onto the PPC's webpage</em>, especially since PPC updates their activity quite often on there. It's a place where a community of prairie activists can build and grow.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Campaigns</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because our re-design was revolved around how our user could save a colony, there was less focus on the campaigns. Especially since these <em>campaigns would help the legitimacy of the website</em>, it is something that we would also be interested in working on in the future.</li>
