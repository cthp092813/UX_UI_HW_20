            <p>Prairie Protection Colorado(PPC) is a non-profit organization that advocates for prairie dogs by drawing attention to the mass exterminations of prairie dog colonies through organizing and resisting the destruction of the last remaining prairie communities. Their website was designed to promote awareness around prairie dog endangerment and allow users to support their cause online.</p>

                    <p>My team and I observed that users often have <em>trouble finding the information</em> they need and found the <em>unprofessional/sketchy look</em> of the PPC’s website off-putting, preventing users from engaging with PPC in meaningful ways like volunteering or working with PPC to save their own local colony. This results in <em>missed opportunities for involvement from potential supporters—leaving the prairie dogs to fend for themselves.</em></p>
                    <p>The solution is to redesign and organize the PPC’s website so that (1) <em>our users feel empowered and informed</em> about the PPC and its cause, (2) users can <em>easily find the information</em> they need, and (3) get <em>users returning to the website.</em></p>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>Our initial approach to conducting our user interviews was to gather insight on what components/factors would make a nonprofit organization seem legitimate/reliable based on their website. I identified to my team while that was useful information, we could also add on a usability test to discover key weaknesses about the website that our team could improve.<br><br>We conducted qualitative interviews + usability tests with 5 participants and found:</p>

            <h3>Stakeholder interview</h3>
            <p>During our stakeholder interview, with Deanna Meyer Treasurer of PPC, our goal was to find out what PPC need their website to do for them, and they wanted the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To <em>find more actionable activists</em> the join the fight not only for the prairie dog, but all of the wildlife along the Rocky Mountains that are being encroached upon due to developments.</li>
                <li>To obtain <em>more donations</em> to use in processes of saving the prairie dogs.</li>
                <li>To have an <em>overall more professional, sleek, and inviting look</em> to the website</li>

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>I conducted a direct competitor analysis with Prairie Dog Coalition and Prairie Dog Pals. We also analyzed some indirect competitors: GoFundMe and Denver Urban Garden.<br><br>Takeaways from our Competitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Hero image</em></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We can utilize a hero image to encase PPC’s mission statement. This would allow users to immediately see their mission statement and have a central idea of not only what the organization is about but also an idea of what they might expect when visiting the website.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><em>Content chunking</em></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Because the content in PPC’s website is not sectioned out, it makes it difficult for users to digest the information their reading which can be off-putting. This further prevents users from being informed about prairie dogs and how to protect them, leaving them to fend for themselves. Content chunking on the PPC’s website would allow users to easily digest the information and be fully informed about what they’re reading.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><em>“Call to Action” buttons</em></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some buttons on PPC’s website are not active and can cause confusion to users what is and isn’t clickable. By adding “call to action” button, this gives the user a straightforward approach on what they can do.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><em>A more sensible navigation bar</em> to help users find what they need</li>

                <p>Because this was a multifaceted website, we wanted to focus back on our user persona, River, and her main goal: To save a prairie colony near her home. We revolved our re-design around this, so that River could intuitively navigate the website and easily save a colony in just a few clicks.</p>
